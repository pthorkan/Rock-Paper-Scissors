* Further down the page is the game score area to the left and right hand side of the screen, displaying the 'Player' and 'Computer' scores. 
* Once the user selects a button or option, it gets pinned underneath the Player score column. 
* The Computer selection is then randomly generated, and pinned beneath the Computer score column automatically. 
* The computer assesses the selections, computes the outcome and pins the result to the centre column. If there is a Player or Computer win, then the respective score counter is increased. If it is a tie, both scores remain the same.
